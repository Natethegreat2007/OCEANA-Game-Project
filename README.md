This is the game project I created using the Godot game engine. 
This repository contains all of the files I used/received and all of the scripts and scenes I programmed (I was the director and solo technical programmer of this project).

My other team members were responsible for anything related to the art, sprite animations, sprite design, background art and research input.

Level 1 - sidescroller where you are to dodge the garbage as you continue right. NPC interaction is included.
Level 2 - a top-down maze adventure level. Object interaction is included (provides useful narrative text). 
Level 3 - a top-down adventure that contains multiple NPC interaction events. The player must find a pearl and deliver it to an NPC to progress.
Level 4 - a turn-based battle (similar to traditional JRPGS)

Cutscenes were also programmed in between certain levels. The Dialogue Manager add-on was used to store Boolean values and program the cutscenes more efficiently.
